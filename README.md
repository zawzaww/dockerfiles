# Linux Stable Docker Image

## Customized Docker Container Image for Compiling Linux Stable Kernel

Docker Hub: [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/zawzaww/linux](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/zawzaww/linux)

Personally, I'm using this Docker contianer image for compiling and building Linux stable kernel tree. Installed minimal required packages and Clang C compiler/toolchain as prebuilt container image based on Ubuntu Linux base image for compiling Linux kernel.

Docker CLI:
```
docker pull zawzaww/linux:stable
```
